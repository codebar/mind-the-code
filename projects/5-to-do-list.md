# Project 5: To-Do List

Estimated difficulty level: Beginner

Recommended technology: Javascript or Ruby

In an event about mindfulness, who can forget about the good old To-Do list?! Today, you will be replicating the basic functions of a to-do list using the language of your choice.

Build the **model logic** before worrying about hooking it all together into a web app.

Questions to think about:

1. What is the MVP?
2. What object(s) do we need?
3. What methods do we need?
4. How do we make our object "show up" in the view?

The extra mile:

1. Add the ability to create, edit, and delete To-Dos.
2. Add the ability to mark items as being complete, at which point they become archived but not deleted.

**REMEMBER!** Today is not about finishing this project. This repository will still be here later on, so you can always return. It is more important that you ask questions, learn new things, and above all -- explore and play!
