# Project 1: Yoga Pose Slot Machine

Estimated difficulty level: Medium

Recommended technology: Javascript or Ruby

Nearly everyone has wandered into a casino (or a Wetherspoon's) at some point and seen slot machine games. The basic gist is, you feed it some money, you pull a lever, and if you're lucky, you win some of your £££ back.

Your task is to mimic the functionality of a slot machine with a silly twist -- use yoga poses instead of cherries and 7's. Build the **model logic** before worrying about hooking it all together into a web app.

Questions to think about:

1. What is the MVP?
2. What does the user journey look like?
3. What are the most important methods to achieve basic functionality?
4. What classes need to be modeled?
5. How does the slot machine "know" what a winning spin is?
6. How will payouts be calculated?

The extra mile:

1. Build a 3-by-3 face, so that diagonals and top/bottom rows can be counted.
2. Research real slot machine algorithms and see how many you can replicate in code.
3. Implement a limit on the number of times a user can pull the lever so that they can no longer play when they run out of money.

**REMEMBER!** Today is not about finishing this project. This repository will still be here later on, so you can always return. It is more important that you ask questions, learn new things, and above all -- explore and play!
