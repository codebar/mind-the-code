# Project 2: Yoga Pose Name Generator

Estimated difficulty level: Beginner

Recommended technology: Javascript or Ruby

Have you ever noticed that yoga poses have really odd names? Downward Dog... Happy Baby... Tree... Wheel... seems like there are a few recurring patterns!

Your task is to build an application that can randomly generate names for new and innovative yoga poses. Maybe we will even be inspired to try them out for real!

Questions to think about:

1. What is the MVP?
2. What are different ways to randomly generate pose names?
3. What are some patterns that you can find among actual yoga poses? Can these be abstracted into rules?
4. What models and methods will you need?

The extra mile:

1. Get the model logic working in the browser with ERB templating (Embedded Ruby).
2. Incorporate some images into the generated poses.
3. Style the page to make it look nice!
4. Try to generate new poses without a page refresh?! (This requires client-side JavaScript.)

**REMEMBER!** Today is not about finishing this project. This repository will still be here later on, so you can always return. It is more important that you ask questions, learn new things, and above all -- explore and play!
