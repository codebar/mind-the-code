# Project 4: Virtual Mood Ring

Estimated difficulty level: Beginner

Recommended technology: Javascript/jQuery

Remember mood rings, from the 90's? You slipped one on your finger and through dazzling color changes, it would inform you (and everyone nearby) whenever you were feeling happy, angry, sad, or perhaps a little flirty ;)

Your task is to mimic the functionality of a mood ring in the web browser.

Questions to think about:

1. What is the MVP?
2. How does the user interact with the virtual mood ring?
3. Will the moods be determined randomly, or by some other mechanism?
4. What classes and methods might you need?

The extra mile:

1. Style it to make it look nice! Look into CSS filters and webkit effects. (make it responsive!)
2. Get some user input, such as the user's name or date of birth, and try to incorporate this into the "mood".

**REMEMBER!** Today is not about finishing this project. This repository will still be here later on, so you can always return. It is more important that you ask questions, learn new things, and above all -- explore and play!
