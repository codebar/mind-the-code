# Project 2: YouTube Lullabies

Estimated difficulty level: Medium/Hard

Recommended technology: Javascript or Ruby

Today, there is a wealth of music on the internet that can be freely accessed. Fortunately for us, many of these websites are developer-friendly -- with the power of an API key, we can easily hook into a service that some other very smart people have built.

Your task is to use the YouTube (or SoundCloud) API to build a small application that finds songs to help users relax. Lullabies, meditation music, white noise...

Questions to think about:

1. What is the MVP?
2. How does the API you've chosen work?
3. What libraries can help you make an HTTP request?
4. Once the response is sent from YouTube or SoundCloud, what will be presented to the user?

The extra mile:

1. Explore how query string parameters work, and see if you can build a search function for the user.
2. Embed an iFrame for streaming the music directly on your page.

**REMEMBER!** Today is not about finishing this project. This repository will still be here later on, so you can always return. It is more important that you ask questions, learn new things, and above all -- explore and play!
