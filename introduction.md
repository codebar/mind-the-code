# Welcome to Mind The Code!

### Workshop 1
### Estimated time: 45 mins

**Purpose**: To practice modeling a real-world systems problem through coding concepts.

**Task**: Transport For London have approached you to design a new system for managing the London Tube system. As a group, create a simple **domain model**.

Before you start, every group should briefly talk about the following concepts. Please feel free to use any and all whiteboard space you can find!

1. What is a class?
2. What is a method?
3. How are objects and methods connected?
4. What does Object-Oriented Design mean?
5. What is a domain model, and what is its purpose?

All domain models will be a little bit different, but all should contain at least the following components:

1. A few classes
2. The responsibilities of those classes
3. Relationships between classes

As you work in your groups, always think M.V.P. - Minimum Viable Product! Every additional component adds complexity -- always be thinking about the trade-off between _complexity_ and _usability_.
